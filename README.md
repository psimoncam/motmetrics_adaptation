# Motmetrics Adaptation
This a slightly modified version of the original py-motmetrics repository (https://github.com/cheind/py-motmetrics).
It has been modified in order to implement two more metrics:
  - The number of different track IDs that each ground truth object has during its lifespan
  - The number of different object IDs that each track has
